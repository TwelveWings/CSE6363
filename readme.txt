This program is written in Python 3. To run it use the command:

python3 main.py <csv_file>.csv

Depending on your environment, you may be able to run it using:

python main.py <csv_file>.csv

<csv_file> must be a valid file name and it must have the extension .csv; otherwise, the program will not run.
